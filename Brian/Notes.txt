## Notes

G = NeuronGroup(...)

# returns subgroups
G[i]
G[i:j]

C = Connection(G1,G2,'var')
# C contains a connection matrix which can be accessed directly
C[i,j]   # where i is the ith neuron in G1, and j is the jth neuron in G2
C[i,j] = ...   # values can be set

# there are 3 types of connection matrixes

DenseConnectionMatrix(...)
# just a regular matrix
# slower than sparse matrix

SparseConnectionMatrix(...)
# only stores non zero values
# adding or deleting a cell makes that cell zero or non-zero
# very fast

DynamicConnectionMatrix(...)
# a sparse matrix that can be modified at run time

PoissonGroup(...)
# group of spike generating neurons
